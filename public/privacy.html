                          either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal

                        <div>A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure

                          likely
                          to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the
                          event
                          that Ferdium becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized
                          access, use or disclosure of personal information Ferdium will promptly investigate the matter
                          and
                          notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware
                          of
                          it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
                          of natural persons. </div>

                          preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No
                          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.

                          automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
                          tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
